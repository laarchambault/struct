# Struct
A construction site planning tool. Struct makes it easy for builders to plan and coordinate jobs with subcontractors.

# Current Features
1. Login with user authentication
2. Add a contact by entering email address. This initializes a contact request. Once approved, builders/subcontractors can use their list of contacts to add users to a job or project
3. Create Jobs
Each job site, or collection of tasks to be managed, is called a 'job'. Builders (or any user) may create a job. Each job utilizes a timeline to display all of the projects (sub-task) related to the job.
4. Project Management
Each job can have multiple projects. Each project can be viewed on the timeline, which can be used to view all projects at-a-glance. Clicking a projects opens a box with project details.
5. Permissions
A builder may add contacts to a specific job or project. There are two permission levels: builder/owner, and subcontractor. A user with builder/owner permissions may view/edit all project details, while a subcontractor can only view a few details about each project. A contact may be given permission on a specific project. This will automatically provide view-only permission to a few details on the entire job, but will also allow a subcontractor to see all details of their own project and make selected edits to their own project.
